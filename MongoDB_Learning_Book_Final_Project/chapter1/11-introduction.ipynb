    "When people use the term “NoSQL database”, they typically use it to refer to any non-relational database. Some say the term “NoSQL” stands for “non SQL” while others say it stands for “not only SQL.” Either way, most agree that NoSQL databases are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables.\n",

    "NoSQL is named like this because it basically follows the opposite approach of SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **No schemas** it means\n",
    "    - NoSQL databases are either schema-free or have relaxed schemas\n",
    "    - Do not require any sort of definition of the schema of the data\n",
    "    - Offers heterogeneous structures of data in the same domain\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **No relations** it means\n",
    "    - NoSQL databases never follow the relational model\n",
    "    - Never provide tables with flat fixed-column records\n",
    "    - Work with self-contained aggregates or BLOBs\n",
    "    - Doesn't require object-relational mapping and data normalization\n",
    "    - No complex features like query languages, query planners,\n",
    "    - referential integrity joins, ACID\n",

    ">- One of the key differentiator is that NoSQL supported by column oriented databases where RDBMS is row oriented database.\n",
    ">- NoSQL seems to work better on both unstructured and unrelated data. The better solutions are the crossover databases that have elements of both NoSQL and SQL.\n",
    ">- RDBMSs that use SQL are schema–oriented which means the structure of the data should be known in advance to ensure that the data adheres to the schema. For example, predefined schema based applications that use SQL include Payroll Management System, Order Processing and Flight Reservations.\n",
    ">- SQL Databases are vertically scalable – this means that they can only be scaled by enhancing the horse power of the implementation hardware, thereby making it a costly deal for processing large batches of data.\n",
    ">- NoSQL databases give up some features of the traditional databases for speed and horizontal scalability. NoSQL databases on the other hand are perceived to be cheaper, faster and safer to extend a preexisting program to do a new job than to implement something from scratch.\n",
    ">- Even though SQL has its own set of limits, it is also a very mature technology, which is well understood, and has a large pool of developers who understand how to use it well.\n",
    ">- More importantly, data Integrity is a key feature of SQL based databases. This means, ensuring the data is validated across all the tables and there’s no duplicate, unrelated or unauthorized data inserted in the system.\n",
    "> Advantages of SQL databases are that they are typically more performant when dealing with more complex queries. Users cite the relational nature of SQL DBs encourages a well-structured database\n",
