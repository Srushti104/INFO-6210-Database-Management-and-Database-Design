    "MongoDB is an open-source database management system (DBMS) that uses a document-oriented database model. MongoDB is written in C++. MongoDB supports various forms of data. MongoDB stores data in flat files using their own binary storage objects. This means that data storage is very compact and efficient, perfect for high data volumes. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which makes the database very flexible and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a document-oriented database model. Each MongoDB database contains collections and which in turn contains documents. Each document can be different and depends on the varying number of fields. The model of each document will be different in size and content from each other. The data model features allow you to store arrays and complex structured in a hierarchical relationshipm"

    "We begin our journey by getting to know the basic mechanics of working with MongoDB. Obviously this is core to understanding MongoDB, but it should also help us answer higher-level questions about where MongoDB fits.\n",

    ">   1. MongoDB has the same concept of a `database` with which you are likely already familiar (or a schema for you Oracle folks). Within a MongoDB instance you can have zero or more databases, each acting as high-level containers for everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">   2. A database can have zero or more `collections`. A collection shares enough in common with a traditional table that you can safely think of the two as the same thing.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    ">   3. Collections are made up of zero or more documents. Again, a `document` can safely be thought of as a row.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    ">   4. A document is made up of one or more `fields`, which you can probably guess are a lot like columns.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    ">   5. `Indexes` in MongoDB function mostly like their RDBMS counterparts.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    ">   6. `Cursors` are different than the other five concepts but they are important enough, and often overlooked, that I think they are worthy of their own discussion. The important thing to understand about cursors is that when you ask MongoDB for data, it returns a pointer to the result set called a cursor, which we can do things to, such as counting or skipping ahead, before actually pulling down data."

    "\n",
    ">- MongoDB is made up of databases which contain collections.\n",
    ">- A collection is made up of documents. \n",
    ">- Each document is made up of fields. \n",
    ">- Collections can be indexed, which improves lookup and sorting performance. \n",
    ">- Finally, when we get data from MongoDB we do so through a cursor whose actual execution is delayed until necessary.\n"

    "\n",
    ">- The truth is that while these concepts are similar to their relational database counterparts, they are not identical. \n",
    ">- The core difference comes from the fact that relational databases define columns at the table level whereas a document-oriented database defines its fields at the document level. That is to say that each document within a collection can have its own unique set of fields. As such, a collection is a dumbed down container in comparison to a table, while a document has a lot more information than a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this is important to understand, don't worry if things aren't yet clear. It won't take more than a couple of inserts to see what this truly means. Ultimately, the point is that a collection isn't strict about what goes in it (it's schema-less). Fields are tracked with each individual document. The benefits and drawbacks of this will be explored in a future chapter."
