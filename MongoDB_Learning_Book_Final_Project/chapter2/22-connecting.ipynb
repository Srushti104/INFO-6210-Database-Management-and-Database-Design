    "The first is that because we're connecting to a cluster, we wanted to give the Mongo Shell the name of all the servers in this cluster. MongoDB is designed to provide high availability access to your data. It does this by enabling you to maintain redundant copies of your data in a cluster called a replica set. We configured our Atlas Cluster to be a three-server replica set in order to help ensure you will always have access to the data. In the event that the primary server goes down due to a software or hardware failure, one of the other servers will step in to continue serving data to clients. If you'd like to know more about how replica sets work, please see the MongoDB documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other thing I'd like to point out about this command is that at the very end here, we can see the word test immediately following this slash.\n",
    "\n",
    "That indicates that we're going to connect to this cluster and we're going to connect it to a database called test. Now if we would prefer to connect to a different database, we can change this to one of the databases we know is available in our Atlas Cluster. Finally, the last thing I'd like to point out about this command is the fact that we're making a secure connection to this cluster. As we did when connecting with Compass, we're using an encrypted connection via SSL and supplying the same username and password we did to connect with Compass."
